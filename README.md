# Useful Docker Compose Files

## Grafana + Prometheus

This folder contains a minimal setup for **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.

### Prometheus

Prometheus is responsible for collecting the metrics generated by your application.  
You must configure it in `./config/prometheus/prometheus.yml`.  
The `app` section in this file provides guidance on what needs to be set up.

### Grafana

Grafana is responsible for aggregating and visualizing the data collected by Prometheus.  
Since both services run inside Docker containers and share the same network, you can find the Grafana configuration in `./config/grafana/provisioning/datasources/prometheus.yml`.

The only configured data source is:

```yaml
url: http://prometheus:9090
```

## Kafka

This setup provides a minimal Kafka environment with the following components:

### Zookeeper
Manages and coordinates Kafka brokers. It keeps track of cluster metadata and leader elections.

### Kafka
The core message broker that stores and distributes messages between producers and consumers.

### Kafdrop (Optional)
A simple web UI for viewing Kafka topics, partitions, and messages.

### Kafka UI (Optional)
A more advanced interface for managing clusters, topics, consumers, and messages.

- Zookeeper must start before Kafka, as Kafka depends on it for coordination.  
- Both **Kafdrop** and **Kafka UI** connect to the Kafka broker using the same network defined in your `docker-compose.yml`.
